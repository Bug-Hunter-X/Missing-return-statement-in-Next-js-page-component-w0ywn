# Missing Return Statement in Next.js Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js applications: a missing `return` statement in a page component.  The `About` page is missing a return statement, which causes a runtime error.

## Bug

The `pages/about.js` file lacks a `return` statement within the `About` component.  This results in an error when the page is rendered.

## Solution

The `pages/aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected version.  A `return` statement is added, ensuring that JSX is returned to Next.js for rendering.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You'll encounter an error.
5. Compare `about.js` and `aboutSolution.js` to see the correction.
